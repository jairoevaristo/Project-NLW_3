## About 

The application was developed to register orphanages in a city and schedule visiting hours, the application uses TypeORM to store the information from registered orphanages, upload photos and store these photos on disk, I learned how to use TypeScript in a project and how its implementation can improve the development of the project. With the project API already made, both the frontend and mobile of the application were built using React and React Native.
<br><br>
## My Contribution to the project

With the knowledge acquired about TYPEORM I added the application a contact field in the orphanage registration table, so I had to work with migrations. In the frontend I implemented a validation of the fields to register a new orphanage using yup and react hook form, and also an implementation that when clicking on the 'contact us' button in the details section of the orphanage the user is sent to start a conversation with the orphanage using the Whatsapp API.
